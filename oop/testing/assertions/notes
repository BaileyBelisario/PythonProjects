We can make simple assertions with the assert keyword

assert accepts an expression

Returns None if the expression is truthy

Raises an AssertionError if the expression is falsy

Accepts an optional error message as a second argument

Should not use it everywhere in the testing code.

If a python file is run with the -O flag then assertions will be avoided
Cannot count on them to run
