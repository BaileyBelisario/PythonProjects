Test smallest parts of an application in isolation(units)
Good candidates for unit testing: individual classes, modules, or functions
Bad candidates for unit testing: an entire application, dependencies across several classes or modules

import unittest
look at documentation

encapsulated as classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase
This inheritance give you access to many assertion helpers that let you test the behavior of your functions
You can run tests by calling unittest.main()

self.assertEqual(x,y)
self.assertNotEqual(x,y)
self.assertTrue(x)
self.assertFalse(x)
self.assertIsNone(x)
self.assertIsNotNone(x)
