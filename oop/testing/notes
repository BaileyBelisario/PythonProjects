Test Driven Development - TDD

Reduce bugs in the existing code
Ensure bugs that are fixed stay fixed
Ensure that new features do not break old ones
Ensure that cleanin up code does not introduce new bugs
Makes development more satisfying

This can slow down developers but it is important

Development begins by writing tests
Once tests are written, write code to make tests pass
Once tests pass, a feature is considered complete


Red,Green,Refactor

Red - Write a test that fails
Green - Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass
Refactor - Clean up the code, while ensuring that the tests still pass
