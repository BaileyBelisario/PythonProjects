tuples are immutable lists
tuples are faster than list
if you know it is not going to change use it
it makes your code safer from bugs because it is static
() to create them or the tuple function

sets are like formal math sets
sets do not have duplicate values
elements in sets are not ordered
you cannot access items in a set by index
combination of dict and list
they are useful if you need to keep track of a collection of elements, without worrying about the order
